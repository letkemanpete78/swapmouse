"# swapmouse" 
Small little C# program to swap primary and secondary mouse buttons.
These settings are reset anytime Windows is restarted.

I wired this to an extra button on my mouse so that I can quickly switch the buttons on the mouse allowing me to go from left handed mouse to right handed mouse with the click of a button.
